       "338390947                                    Great location and very efficient communication with the Lavenda Team. Apartment furnishing very basic with no personal touch whatsoever. Bedroom facing the street was quite noisy due to traffic. Bus stop in front of the door and 500m walk to nearest underground station. Regent’s Park is just minutes away by foot.   \n",
       "338404448  This is shared space with private rooms on two floors above a cafe on busy Cambridge Heath Road in Bethnal Green. The location is fabulous if you are looking to be in the middle of East London fun. It is a two minute walk from the Bethnal Green tube station, and a block from Paradise Row, which has several amazing bars and restaurants. It is a ...   \n",

       "338412470                              Dani is a great host and quick to respond to any queries. The room was as the pictures show with a nice balcony area and great links around London close by. It can be quite noisy and there was an issue with a mouse being spotted that Dani rectified straight away, however this sadly effected my first night staying there.   \n",

A great place to stay!   \n",

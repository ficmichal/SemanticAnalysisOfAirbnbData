       "14    This was our first BnB experience and we were very pleased.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  A delightful lady from upstairs made our stay more enjoyable and managed a maintenance issue while we were out.  Location was excellent, directly on the bus lines and short walks to two tube stations...  \n",

Just a few minutes from the Tube, other public transit, and food options. Don’t let the staircase intimidate you when you first enter, it’s well worth the climb up for the lovely flat that Tobias &amp; Annette have put together. If at all concerned just take it slow. The decor and furniture was very stylish and the little touches really brought the place together. The shower setup was perfect after a long day of exploring, as was the bed and it’s pillows. If you are in need of a place to stay while in London I would highly recommend you check out one of Tobias and Annette’s offerings.</td>\n",

       "337115940  Tobias & Annette’s place was wonderful and made for the perfect starting point for our adventures daily. Just a few minutes from the Tube, other public transit, and food options. Don’t let the staircase intimidate you when you first enter, it’s well worth the climb up for the lovely flat that Tobias & Annette have put together. If at all concerned just take it slow. The decor and furniture was very stylish and the little touches really brought the place together. The shower setup was perfect after a long day of exploring, as was the bed and it’s pillows. If you are in need of a place to stay while in London I would highly recommend you check out one of Tobias and Annette’s offerings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "337116130  Although we haven't met Ryan in person, communication went extremely well with him. He usually responds within a couple of minutes, which gives a good sense of trust. Check-in procedure is easy and clearly explained by Ryan.\\nThe house is very spacious: large living room, kitchen and access to the garden on the ground floor, bedroom and bath room with toilet on the first floor, and 2 separate bedrooms on the second floor, all bedrooms equipped with a comfortable queen size bed and enough towels. Would easily fit 6 people, but you do need to have a bathroom schedule set-up ;-) \\nThe place is very clean, the old floors in some places a bit squeaky, but hey... it's London baby!\\nThe location of Ryan's place is great: right in the middle of Camden Town (5 minute walk from tube station), with the Stables and many restaurants in a walking distance. \\nWould definitely stay again.\\n\\nThanks Ryan, we enjoyed our stay.\\nMark   \n",

       "337116560  The very best location! Walking distance to everything. Restaurants, convenient stores, souvenir stores, coffee shops, shopping, trains, buses, all footsteps from this apt. The only negative is that the escalator was out of order. 3 or 4 floors with luggage wasn’t pleasing after a long journey to this destination. The apt was a bit small but perfect for our group of 5. We actually rented the two apartments next to each other. 5 in one and 6 in the other. They’re almost identical.

Really new building, good design! My recommendations! Ideal for 4 people, very bright, warm and ideal place. Registration was easy and hassle-free. A lot of information and contact with the owner before registering, and a really friendly owner. I would like to stay here again!
